# aPRAM
 aPRAM is a framework for building probabilistic, relational agent-based models (PRAMs). The central ideas in aPRAM are:

- To vectorize computation for speed;
- To make agents behave stochastically rather than deterministically;
- To make behaviors depend on relations between agents

aPRAM is built on Numpy, so most operations are vectorized and relatively fast. You don't need to know Numpy to build aPRAM models.
